 - Project on Air Quality Analysis 
Air quality is measured with the Air Quality Index, or AQI. The AQI works like a thermometer that runs from 0 to 500 degrees. However, instead of showing changes in the temperature, the AQI is a way of showing changes in the amount of pollution in the air. Air quality is a measure of how clean or polluted the air is.
